  LongDescription: Yezzik the Unlucky has been plagued by strange dreams of a Tomb.
    The eastern wind brings the sounds of distant screams to Brodvar's ears. And
    Forbell has sensed dark stirrings in the Fens. These unlikely heroes must find
    each other and the cause of their disturbances, or the world is doomed to a century
    under darkness.
